           <h4> RM (Kim Namjoon)</h4>
            <p> RM, once Rap Monster, is the leader of the group and one of the rappers of the group.He was the first one recruited for the group and only one who can speak English fluently, thus he is usually the one who does the talking in English interviews. When BTS is writing their own songs, usually the producers take RM's writing into the songs. His IQ is said to be on the genius level. Although he is the leader, he is not the oldest member. He was born on September 12, 1994, has a dog name Rapmon, and is the clumsiest member of thr group. He has been seen in videos breaking glasses he just bought, beds, the glass floor from dancing, and even simply standing there but the bag he was carrying ripped. RM used to be called Rap Monster, but he felt as he got older he wanted a more professional name so he initialized it, into RM. RM also has his own songs such as Change with rapper Wale. RM is highly respected by his other members and although may have a strong apperance, he is very sweet.

              <h4> Jin (Kim Seokjin) </h4>
          <p> Jin is the oldest member of thr group and one of the vocalists. He was born on December 4th, 1992. He can cook and used to cook often for the members when they first debuted and the company, BigHit Entertainment, was still small. Jin even has his own segment called Eat Jin, on website Vlive where they stream live, and eats food and discussing how he and BTS are doing as well as answering ARMYs questions He enjoys Nitendo, romances, and especially making dad jokes. His signature move is blowing kisses, which started in 2016 when he blew a kiss in the music video Fire. He had a beloved dog Jjanggu, but had passed in early September,2017. He now has two sugar gliders. Jin revealed this year his background of his family, being that his father is a CEO of a company, but he didnt reveal which because he wants to keep things private. He also has one older brother. There are no pictures out either of how his parents look.He was seen as the underrated member as he would not have a lot of lines and was seen as the least best dancers. But after a incident where Jin was cropped out of a photo, ARMYs constantly spoke out on the issue. Thus they worked out the issue.

          <h4> Suga (Min Yoongi) </h4>
          <p> Suga is another rapper in the group and got his name because when he smiles he looks sweet like sugar. Suga was born on March 9th, 1993, but is jokingly called the child of the group by members, but grandpa by ARMYs. He is very passionate about music. Before BTS, he was very poor and it also affected his mental health, He gravely suffered depression as he speaks about in his mixtape Agust D, song Last of Me. He dreamt of going far with music that he would have to choose between either spening money on food or transportation to take him to places that will help him continue his music. This has caused him to go nights and days without eating. Now he spends hours in his own little studio, working on music and song writing. Suga although in pictures he looks sweet, he is also considered the "savage" of the group, making sarcastic remarks and making faces when members act silly or extra. </p>
